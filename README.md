# QEA
Final controls project for Quantitative Engineering Analysis (QEA) at Olin College, 2016.

The goal of this project is to independently derive the equations of motion of a quadcopter, simulate its flight and attitude over time, and code a functioning flight controller for a DJI Flamewheel 450.
